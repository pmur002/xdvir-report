+ Example from Marc-Olivier Beausoleil

  ./gif.walking.adaptive.landscape.R

  The code did NOT fully run for me - the image_animate() call ran out
  of resources - BUT the PNG frames were built by then so I just ...

  ffmpeg -i output/adaptive_land.animation/_fitplot.gif/adapt.land.example%03d.png output/adaptive_land.animation.gif

  ... which is too fast on the initial frames, but ...

  The animation is not so important to me - I just need one of the frames
  as an example of a plot that includes a text label that requires some
  typesetting that appears simple, but actually involves some things that
  you need LaTeX for (like math and full justification and hyphenation).
